# Overview

This project aims to be governed in a transparent, accessible way for the benefit of the community. All participation in this project is open and not bound to corporate affilation. Participants all our bound the project's Code of Conduct.

# Project roles

## Contributor

The contributor role is the starting role for anyone participating in the project and wishing to contribute code.

### Process for becoming a contributor

* Review the CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines to ensure your contribution is inline with the project's coding and styling guidelines.
* Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO signoff
* Have your submission approved by the maintainer(s) and merged into the codebase.

## Committer

The committer role enables the participation to commit code directly to the repository, but also comes with the responsibility of being a responsible leader in the community.

### Process for becoming a committer

* Show your experience with the codebase through contributions and engagement on the community channels.
* Request to become a committer.
* Have the majority of committers approve you becoming a committer.
* Your name and email is added to the MAINTAINERS.md file for the project.

### Committer responsibilities

* Monitor email aliases.
* Monitor Slack (delayed response is perfectly acceptable).
* Triage GitHub issues and perform pull request reviews for other committers and the community.
* Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them.
* In general continue to be willing to spend at least 25% of ones time working on the project (~1.25 business days per week).

### When does a maintainer lose maintainer status

If a committer is no longer interested or cannot perform the committer duties listed above, they
should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of
the maintainers per the voting process below.

## Lead

Each sub-project is managed by a project lead. Collectively, Zowe Project leads are responsible for ensuring that their project's committers are following the Development Process, and that the project is engaging in the right sorts of activities to develop vibrant communities of users, contributors and committers. Each project lead is equal in responsibility.  Subsequently, additional project leads must be elected by the project's committers.

# Release Process

Project releases will occur on a scheduled basis as agreed to by the maintainers. Coordination of Zowe releases is led by the [CI/CD squad](https://github.com/zowe/community/tree/master/CI-CD), and all Zowe releases are to be approved by the ZLC.

# Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the maintainers can be
called in to decide an issue. If the maintainers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will
be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each maintainer receives one vote.

# Communication

This project, just like all of open source, is a global community. In addition to the Code of Conduct, this project will:

* Keep all communucation on open channels ( mailing list, forums, chat ).
* Be respectful of time and language differences between community members ( such as scheduling meetings, email/issue responsiveness, etc ).
* Ensure tools are able to be used by community members regardless of their region.

If you have concerns about communication challenges for this project, please contact the maintainers.
