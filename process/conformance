Zowe Conformance

Zowe is an integrated and extensible framework designed to allow users the flexibility to choose how they 
interact with z/OS. In order to better serve this goal, the Zowe community is developing a Conformance Program. 
The Zowe Conformance Program gives users the confindence that when they use a conformant product or app, they can rely
on a high level of common functionality and interoperability. Conformance provides Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), System
Integrators (SIs) and end users confidence that their software will behave as expected.
Just like Zowe, the Conformance program will continue to evolve and is managed by contributors in our community. The program
is divided into two parts: 1) Zowe Conformant Applications and 2) Zowe Conformant Distribution.  

Zowe Conformant Applications

Zowe Conformant Applications are designed to integrate with any Zowe Conformant Distribution. In order for an application
to be Conformant it must adhere to the following checklist:
1. Developers Guidelines <link>
- Code Guidelines: https://zowe.org/code-guidelines/

2. Visual Design and User Interaction <link>
  - Design Guidelines
  - Navigation
  - Notifications
  - etc.
  
3. Functionality <link>
  - SSO
  - Install
  - CLI
  - API Mediation Layer
  - Web UI
  - App Completeness <link>
    -  No temporary content
    - Tested for bugs
    - etc.
  
 4. Architectural Design <link>
 
 5. Compatibility, performance and stability <link>
  - Stability
  - Performance
  - Visual Quality?
 
 6. Security <link>
  - GDPR/Data Compliance?
  - App to App - How do application components that share data with other apps or components that should be invoked by other apps,
  are exported?
  - Networking?
  - Libraries?
  - Webviews?
  - Execution?
  - Cyptography?
  
 7. Testing? <link>
  - Which tests does it need to pass?CLI, WebUI, API, etc.?
  
 8. List/Link to Zowe App Directory? <link>
  - When we get an app directoy, ensure that it has the appropriate material and ensure the app is unique?
  
  Zowe Conformant Distribution
  
  Zowe Conformant Distributions is the Zowe open source project components and any other commercial or open source additions
  which is bundled bu a vendor and shipped as a product. Int order to have a Zowe Conformant Distribution if must adhere to 
  the following checklist:
  
  1. Meets the quality standards described in the Zowe Conformant Application Program <link above>
  
  2. Brand Guidelines <link>
  
  3. Marks (i.e. the logos) <link>
  
  4. Terms and Conditions <link>

Once checklist items are confirmed, please submit an application to use Zowe name and marks?
Best practice is to work through the on-boarding squad to ensure that your application meets the intent of the conformance program 
and improve the chances of meeting conformance on first submission.
If there this is a confidential/commercial Zowe application the trademark submission will be reviewed by the Linux Foundation and 
usage will be granted on the assumption that it meets all conformance criteria. If the confidential application does is found to be
non-conformaant, usage rights will be revoked.
