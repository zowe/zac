# ZLC Agenda 01-22-2020
1. **Close on LTS Policy and agree to go public - voting topic**

   1. I think what we concluded was no re-version in 2020 therefore I took another pass at how to document policy [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72)

   1. I think we agreed V1 would be supported for 2 years beginning in Feb 2020 

   1. Note: I made some new words on N-1 backward compatibility criteria we should discuss 

   1. Comment: I think we agreed to take the view that Zowe V1 is a "suite" of software and not all components need to have the V1 number scheme (i.e., the CLI can be V2 and be part of Zowe Suite V1 - example is CLI plug ins have their own numbering yet are compatible 

   1. @joe - you mentioned a draft of LTS blog but I was not able to find it?? Can you provide pointer. 

1. **Conformance criteria**

   1. **If we agree we are staying with Zowe V1 through 2020 BUT we want to improve the conformance criteria (in future SSO, for example) - what do we link the new criteria to? **

      1. **Zowe 2020 is not clear**

      1. **Zowe V1 is not clear**

      1. **New badge style? for this first LTS and then follow version number?**

         1. **What is status of new logo?**

1. **Follow up on Mobile Project proposal**

   1. Proposal accepted but no agreement on committers 

   1. Questions on next steps? 

      1. Do we put "help wanted" out for someone to take over code? 

      1. Can Broadcom contribute someone to help get vendor neutral build process in place? Work with OMP. 

1. **Hackathon status?**

1. **On Boarding - improve process handling of questions**

   1. Many thanks to Rose and On Boarding team for proposing better Q&A flow - let's discuss if there is time.
