# ZLC Agenda 02-12-20
1. **Congrats to everyone getting 1.8 out** - have we heard any feedback? 

   1. JRW - German Business Partner commented on the doc for install and configure being easier.  They are very happy with being able to lifecycle extender products as part of the Zowe started task.

   1. JRW - Some iFrame extenders finding problems with permissions and doc which is being addressed for 1.9

   1. JRW - French Bank and 2 UK banks have commented that they are installing 1.8 using SMP/E for the first time now it supports PTF replacement

   1. I saw one early adopter claim to have it up and running. On to 1.9 and Active LTS (for the z/OS components - CLI is already there {8-)..) 

1. **Some admin-istrivia**

   1. Are the current ZLC members on the zowe-zlc dist list? and zowe-zlc-private? 

   1. I have not been sending to zowe-dev but can - everyone is welcome 

   1. and I know I need to move to github rather than box - still on my to-do list 

   1. Agenda links seems to expire - if someone wants access and they can't link please send me email and I will figure out how to fix 

1. **LTS announce (and other topics)** - I think we are in agreement on policy - I've just not had time to link with the doc squad on drafting up a proposal for placement on the zowe.org website and creation of the words for the process docs - any volunteers? 

   1. I propose we update web site with policy, conformance criteria and updated Q&A flow on 1.9 GA?

1. **Hackathon planning** - Jean-Louis or Premek

   1. Dates of the hackathon as Feb 23- April 5. It gives everyone 6 weeks to get their projects together. 

   1. Launch it to the media on Feb 20 in our press release and  feature it in all of the SHARE presentations, including the Zowe event on Feb 23.  

   1. Info about evaluation and judging. 

   1. OMP can host a webinar where each team has 5-10 minutes to present their project, judges will review and then we could announce winners via virtual meetup and blog. 

   1. We could also invite winners to OSS NA (June) to present their winning project at a OMP event (weâ€™re hoping to have a co-located event at OSS NA much like the one we had last year). 

   1. [Virtual Hackathon Site content(1).pdf](Virtual%20Hackathon%20Site%20content(1).pdf)

1. **Other content for the press release?**

1. **Proposal for a "Zowe Developer Kit" (ZDK) subproject under Zowe.**  Rose or other? 

   1. This subproject would enable Zowe CLI to be extended to languages beyond Node.JS, i.e. Python et al.  Possible demo at Share 

   1. Zowe Explorer related topic? Sujay? 

1. **Terminology: I have been guilty of this - passing along for others - Use "initial contributor" not "founding member" when referring to the 3 companies**

1. **For awareness: [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/159](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/159)** Proposal to get license for service called "AWS Device Farm" Update? I think John has made proposal 

1. **SHARE**

   1. Sunday education session 

      1. John - still need to close on catering 

   1. BOF now Tuesday evening 

   1. and Discussion Topic? organized by Share 

1. **Next steps for mobile app?**

1. **Zowe CLI on USS - cool! - can someone explain the positioning of this? Experimental? "Supported"?**

   1. [https://medium.com/@plape/installing-node-js-on-the-mainframe-both-linux-and-z-os-to-run-zowe-cli-19abb6494e41](https://medium.com/@plape/installing-node-js-on-the-mainframe-both-linux-and-z-os-to-run-zowe-cli-19abb6494e41)

1. **IMS REST APIs as part of Zowe convenience build  (Update next week)**

   1. Discussions with the IMS team, 

      1. For the CLI they want to be conformant and described in the zowe.org docs, similar to DB2 and CICS CLI plugins 

      1. they have a Springboot dynamic API discoverable runtime for their APIs and want to distribute this on zowe.org.   More investigation will take place for optimal way to do this, and stop gap is for it to be available on a twistie tab similar to "pre-release-builds", e.g. "API extensions" that would link to the download site of the springboot.pax and its install and configure docs.  Reason to not deliver this in the base is that where would this lead to - discuss !

1. **Voting on logo?**

1. **ZLC nominations?**
