Zowe ZLC - Working meetings -  https://zoom.us/j/935375531
Wed 10/30/2019 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM eastern time zone 		


Although Matt will be back today, I will host the call

Topics:

1) I made final tweaks to LTS slides - if we agree on policy - I recommend a vote either today or via email to close this issue out. See https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72for latest info

2) Squad leads were emailed to ask their opinion on when LTSR tagged items in backlog could be done in 2020 to target Maintenance LTS - hopefully we can discuss target and/or roadblocks or trade-offs
