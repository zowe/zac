# ZLC Agenda 01-29-2020
1. **LTS policy**

   1. Need Joe to review and vote on LTS policy[https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72)

   1. John recommends for LTS that we document in the Process Release Docs - [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/blob/master/process/ReleaseProcess.md](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/blob/master/process/ReleaseProcess.md) 

   1. I'd like to propose we document there and also use the ppt diagram and bullet points (off the main zowe.org page) for a quick and easy reference (I don't think many people read the Process Docs) 

   1. Based on comments in the github there is still confusion on when breaking changes are introduced - open to how to clarify? 

      1. Breaking change (with no work around) is on a version boundary

      1. Breaking change (or what I call "changes of note" like ++Hold jargon in SMP/E speak) that DO have a work around (via doc or config file change) are allowed on release boundary provided:

         1. Notice is given to the consumer ahead of time (doc, warning message, etc.). 

      1. Coordination with Conformance Criteria - conformance will be on version boundary not release boundary 

      1. **Can we give go ahead for Doc squad to draft up changes for LTS, Conformance (if ready) and clarified Q&A process (see below)? **

1. **Conformance Criteria - status of update?**

1. **On Boarding squad proposal for updated process flow for Q&A - I'd like to propose this be updated on zowe.org when LTS policy updates**

1. **Request for better linkage with OMP marketing**

   1. Press release planned for "mid Feb" - can Zowe team contribute content? 

      1. **John/Mae** - would be helpful to exact dates of when content is needed

   1. Possible content: 

      1. LTS policy 

      1. Announce of LTS Release 

      1. One year anniversary of Zowe 1.0 

      1. Significant customer or ISV testimonials 

      1. Hack-a-thon

   1. Request to better understand what events OMP is planning - ZLC requested to share what we are planning 

      1. SHARE, IDUG, TECHU

      1. Obviously "closed door" meetings with customers, SIs and ISVs excluded from sharing. Sharing of specific customer conversations excluded. 

      1. Bruce did recent no-no on podcast when OMP was not made aware - podcast review not done. Some trademark errors quickly corrected. 

         1. **Do we need trademark refresher? **

      1. Request to have "standard" what is Zowe deck for all to use - including public use cases - he had this at Zowe announce and have strayed from it - can we get a team to update? Who to own and lead? 

1. **Hack-a-thon status?**

1. **Terminology: I have been guilty of this - passing along for others - Use "initial contributor" not "founding member" when referring to the 3 companies**

1. **For awareness: [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/159](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/159)**. Proposal to get license for service called "AWS Device Farm"

1. **Next steps for mobile app?**

1. **Zowe 1.9.0 (January 28, 2020 - February 25, 2020)**

   1. Sprint 1 (Jan 28, 2020 - Feb 10, 2020)

      1. SMP/E PTF Support (Convenience build upgrade documentation)

      1. Node v12 Support (target)

   1.  Sprint 2 (Feb 11, 2020 - Feb 24, 2020)
