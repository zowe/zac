# ZLC Agenda 12-11-19
I have sent access to this agenda via shared link and tried to grant R/W authority - unclear if it is working. 



1. **Follow up: Two requests to the On-Boarding squad -**

   1. **Rose (On Boarding scrum master_ to attend next few ZLC to keep us up to date on items ) **

   1. **Ask to get more consistency in communication to people with Q&A on Zowe** - see last week agenda topic 

      1. We use slack, dev email dist list and community forum differently. 

         1. Another suggestion was using Git issues for Q&A 

      1. Ask is to see what we could do better? - Clarify which tool for which request? 

         1. **John** - request for Enterprise license of Slack keeps coming up to allow backward searches - can we work on this for 2020? 

   1. **Ask to refine what we do and say about Conformance program in 2020** 

      1. Current conformance program has a year designation (2019) - as we decide what (if) "break changing" there will be in 2020 will year designation work? 

   1. **How we got here: **

         1. LTS policy proposal (noting there are some differences in z/OS components and CLI)

            1. Targeting Zowe 1.10 on z/OS as "Active LTS" - targeting "mid 2020" (ballpark) for "Maintenance LTS" after items in Zenhub with LTS tag are completed 

            1. What do we do with Zowe conformance program in mid 2020? 

               1. One suggestion is to interview Zowe exploiters for input 

               1. We will need to publish changes for exploiters to adopt (example SSO) for conformance re-certification 

               1. Can we have test cases for certification by then (vs self certify process today)? 

            1. CLI has already introduced some breaking changes in their "Active Development" [https://docs.zowe.org/active-development/getting-started/summaryofchanges.html](https://docs.zowe.org/active-development/getting-started/summaryofchanges.html)

         1. Reminder - as we publish LTS policy our discussions have lead us to what to say about backward compatibility (I think we agree N-1 from one version to the next). 

1. **Any summary from the CLI/API ML PI planning someone wants to give? **

   1. CLI on USS? 

1. **Node V12 on z/OS announced **

   1. [https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/9/897/ENUS219-549/index.html&lang=en&request_locale=en](https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/9/897/ENUS219-549/index.html&lang=en&request_locale=en)

1. **Whatever happened to handing sample code licenses? **

1. **From OMP Marketing meeting:** 

   1. 3 Chinese universities (Beijing Institute of Technology, South China University of Technology, Xidian University) to join OMP? 

      1. John any other info? 

1. **Hackathon status? **

1. **SHARE Zowe education** - any more thoughts on hands on vs lecture/demo? If hands on what z systems? 

   1. Assume travel approvals will be happening at beginning of 2020 - we need a marketing effort to drive attendance 

   1. Depending on pre-regs we can see about the cost of providing lunch to those who attend 

1. **Marist build environment moving forward **with ACF2/Top Secret install and config 

1. ZLC meetings 

   1. Propose Dec 18 be held (next week) 

   1. Cancel Dec 25th and Jan 1

   1. Restart Jan 8th
