Note - I know there is issue with DCO on my meeting agendas - I need to find time to figure it out 

1) Request from Mae for reviewers of the press release please - she's asking for one from each initial contributor company

I’m still in the process of drafting the press release but would love to have three volunteer reviewers from the ZLC (one from each company). Please let me know who the volunteers are.

Once the draft is complete, which I’m hoping will be later this week, here’s what the review process looks like: 
- Zowe review for content accuracy (three volunteers)
- John reviews on behalf of OMP
- LF reviews 
- FYI to marketing chairs
- FYI to GB
- FYI to LF leadership and management
- Approved and sent to PR Newswire

2) Review summary of the PI Planning content and discuss if there is anything ZLC wants to request to be considered by the squads. 
(Discuss how we may want to help mobile incubator.) 

Draft survey questions: https://ibm.box.com/s/jzkijoskh1mhurzaj2bpzadl42wwxe38 for discussion next Monday with squad leads 

3) Also from Mae - We’d like your help in creating the playbook for the next hackathon. Please add in all your feedback by EOD Friday, June 5.

4) Review ZLC issues https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues
