I will be hosting ZLC call today in Matt's absence - proposed topics

1) Review with the squads of their items for LTS and possible target for completion

2) Review DRAFT support policy announcement - posted in the ZLC issue:  https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72(Note in the draft policy I have an "optional paragraph" regarding the use of configuration "switch" mentioned last week - we need to decide how/if we want to include this. Also there was a suggestion to product "depreciation warning messages" where possible - do we want to provide that?)

3) Zowe Hackathon planning - discuss when/how/invitees, etc.

4) Proposed Zowe education at SHARE Feb Feb 23rd

I have a feeling this will fill the hour but other topics are welcome - time permitting......
