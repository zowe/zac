## Branching Strategy Announcement
Nick shared the branching strategy.  See the branching meeting notes for details.


## IMS API contribution Update 
IMS team still seeking IBM approval to contribute - taking longer than expected but still being worked - once approved plan will be to move to location where code can be scanned by LF before move into zowe github 

## z/OS Proprietary Binary Access
RACF.jar - try to push builds to the z/OS systems as the fall back position.  Ideally, we need to challenge the licensing to make non-proprietary items available through new licensing.

## Update on "z/OS Private Cloud" 
Continuing to work with Marist and VCU.  Marist is willing to host build infrastructure with named access to resources.  (Not generally / freely available).  Bruce to include John in future discussions to help promote braoder OMP relationships for LF infrastructure around mainframe.


## Update on LF infrastructure
Alvin was discussing current build versus LF infra options.  Alvin to continue discussion with John and levelset.

## Zowe Website Transition from WP to Pages
Matt to contact Ally and work out a plan to move the website.

## Documentation - Looking for a vendor neutral platform.  Suggestions (not exhaustive) are Google Docs on a par with Box.  Need to allow for community members to edit and everyone to read without registration (goal if possible).  @nick volunteered to investigate and make a recommendation.  Looking for an update next week.
@John to contact infrastructure to setup a Confluence instance so we can experiment to use that service from the LF.  
  
## Binary download hosting
Matt to create an issue to track.
