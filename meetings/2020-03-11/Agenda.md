# ZLC Agenda 03-11-20
1. **[https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72) LTS tweak**

   1. Sujay - saw Joe in agreement 

      1. I would not call this "support policy". It would be better to call it something like "Release Timeline". People are confused about the term "Support" as they're mixing it up with enterprise support where they can call someone and receive support for using Zowe. 

      1. I don't think this line is necessary as it's misleading. The chart shows more than just LTS, it's the full release phases/cadence where LTS is only part of it. 

   1. Request from Mark to show Conformance Program changes on chart??? 

   1. Where I think we are

      1. Conformance update wording complete? 

      1. OMP legal review? 

      1. Do we want to publish LTS and point to existing conformance policy? 

      1. Where are we with new conformance policy agreement? 

   1. Move Conformance Criteria to Github 

      1. Items to be "supported" to be conformant?

   1. Now that we have two vendors with commercial support offerings - we need to establish policy/guidelines/rules?
