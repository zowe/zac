Would someone review and approve past meeting agenda pull requests - I don't think there is anything controversal in them. 

1) Recap of Segus webinar - any action items we (ZLC) should take based on what we heard - I was not able to stay on the full hour but
it sounded like the understood our positioning, technology and vision? Hopefully they will seek conformance of their future deliverable.
(I counted 48 attendees which seemed like a good turn out). 

2) OMP webinar coming up - May 28 - slides requested by 18th and practice run on the 20th 
      For Bruce: LTSR and Zowe conformance program   …a description of the LTSR program, why it was done and what it means for Zowe community
      of users and developers, and also same for the conformance program.
      For Peter, What is the Zowe community doing to make Zowe ready for Production deployments?   …a description of features and capabilities
      added in past three months and planned for next few months specifically towards making Zowe suitable for production deployments.
    If we want to use this as facilator for "What is Zowe" deck we have short runway.....I propose using the deck that I used with ISVs
    which is not a "What is Zowe" deck as much as what's new....
 
 3) Let's run through ZLC issues - https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues 
 
 Feel free to bring up additional items
