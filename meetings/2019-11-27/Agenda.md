# ZLC Agenda - 11-27-19
1. **RC 1.7.1 available** - teams urged to test - only change made in code (zLUX change) Issue #114 

1. **ZLC seat **- nominations closed 11/25/19 - voting until 12/4/19 - I see voting has begun via email for Joe Winchester. 

1. **Expiring Giza domain names appear to have triggered several threads: **

   1. **Do we know when does names expire and can we meet that date? **

   1. For release artifacts versioned under **1.0.0**, the distribution was NOT EPL-2.0. Are there any legal issues hosting non-EPL artifacts on LF Artifactory, and if so, what are our options for archiving these artifacts? [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/156](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/156)

   1. Linux Foundation Jenkins - multiple topics - some related to permissions - work in progress 

1. **Documenting LTS policy - what to say about Conformance? **

   1. What do we say about Conformance v1 (or Conformance 2019) users? Will they continue to work against Zowe v1.x Active LTS? We discussed last week on the ZLC about breaking changes into the v1.x LTS drop....and this impacts for Conformance v1. If we intend to break, we must give the 60-90 day heads up if I recall correctly...

   1. Recommend adding bullet to LTS policy saying Conformance criteria will change with future versions and give the 60-90 day preview of new criteria. 

1. Other topic from last week - [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/153#issuecomment-558778254](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/153#issuecomment-558778254) - 

   1. **Comment - ****we should create a doc in the ZLC with this checklist, focused on the steps required for any component to be included in a zowe.org deliverable.**** ****Thoughts?**

   1. This is the checklist the squad came up with:

      1. Documentation and Naming

      1. Automated build and test

      1. EPL 2.0 License

      1. NPM audit

      1. Security scanning

      1. Documentation peer-review

      1. UX review

      1. Automated deployment to staging artifactory (currently Giza)

      1. Automated deployment to public NPM

      1. TPSRs <-------pardon my ignorance - what is this? 3rd party licenses check 

1. **What to do and say about z/OS 2.4 testing** [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/144](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/144)

   1. Last check with Marist is them getting 2.4 is months away (they rely on system build from a team in IBM) - I do not see a way to claim day 1 Zowe support of new levels of z/OS or Z hardware unless we (Zowe community) somehow joins the z/OS beta program under Non Disclosure Agreement and that is contrary to being "open". 

   1. Recommend closing this issue as no resolution found? 

   1. What is status of Zowe testing on z/OS 2.4 testing in the Zowe founding members? 

1. **Survey: **Open Mainframe Project members,  As we close on 2019, we'd love to get feedback from each of you on the progress of the Open Mainframe Project and the LF staff support of the project. To aid in this, please complete the survey below by EOD December 6, 2019.
