# ZLC Agenda 01-08-2020
Welcome to 2020 - hope everyone had good holidays. Some news items (correct me if I have them wrong). 



* Mark Ackert will be out a few weeks - Mike Bauer to sub for him. Welcome Mike. 

   * Quick process question to John for sub to vote on issues - how is that handled? 

* I'm told Peter Fandel from Rocket will be joining ZLC calls - welcome Peter. 



1. **Status of Zowe 1.8 **

   1. Great progress on getting to "Active LTS candidate" but expect there will be 1.9? 

      1. "Maintenance LTS" target for 2H2020

   1. Target is next couple weeks to have a release candidate 

   1. Generally on track for Feb 2020 release barring any surprises 

1. **Document, agree and post - need a working group established to close on these - volunteers? **

      1. LTS policy

         1. Status of BLOG to discuss? 

      1. Backward compatibility statement 

      1. Publish "changes of note" (aka "breaking changes"?) for exploiters/extenders - we are likely already late in publishing changes per our policy of 60-90 days notice 

      1. Conformance program updates 

1. **Hackathon proposal made just before the holidays **

   1. Assumption is that participants will provide their own z/OS environment 

      1. Zowe team will assist with set up Q&A - this sounds like decision for On Boarding squad as to whether they have capacity

   1. Does team provide any education beyond what is already available? Webex on install? 

   1. IBM had internal discussion as to whether we need to base hackathon on Zowe 1.8 - general conclusion was not to wait and use 1.7.1 as code (knowing 1.8 will change the install and config process) 

      1. Other squads agree? 

   1. Timing????? 

      1. First couple weeks of Feb ???? 

   1. Taken from deck 

      1. What's needed: 

         1. Web page for information and team registrations (can OMP host it?) <-----I assume yes

         1. Communication channel for participants (Slack?) <---------question on volunteers that have the skills/bandwidth 

         1. Community support for participants (before and during the hackathon) <-------concern on the time commitment 

         1. Prizes?

         1. Judges?

   1.     Criteria?  - I assume this criteria to win? 

   1. Ask: 

      1.  Couple of volunteers to help with the organization <-------who - we would need to name names  

         1. IBM does not have additional resource other than existing members of the On Boarding squad - need to see if that team has capacity 

      1. Web resources (website, slack channel)

      1. Judges to evaluate the results and facilities for the evaluation (Webex, Zoom meeting?)

      1. Prizes? 

1. **SHARE Sunday education **- Bruce to check on enrollments 

1. **Email regarding "****customer involved webinar****" - driven by On Boarding Squad (I think) **

   1. "Zowe User Community Virtual Meetup" 

   1. Ideally this should be customer led and the customers create their own user community that we as committers/vendors/Zowe squad members are in service of. 

   1. How to publicize? 

   1. Is this ongoing? (i.e., first Friday of month type schedule?) 

   1. Attendees set agenda?
