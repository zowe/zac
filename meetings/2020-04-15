Attempting to use Github for meeting agenda rather than box - we will see how bad I screw this up. 

Release 1.10 out - thanks for everyone help - any early adopter feedback? https://docs.zowe.org/stable/getting-started/summaryofchanges.html

Let's review Issues for any updates with focus on two: 

    1) LTS go to market: https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/176#issuecomment-613703143
    
    2) Squad proposal: https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/161 - this is first step for Zowe Explorer and CLI as separate squads 
      Other proposals to follow on other aspects 
      
    Any updates to other issues: https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues
    
    FYI: https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository
    
    Proposal for new issues: 
    
      1) In an internal meeting we briefly discussed the state of backup with github and learned releases are backed up but 
      other "extended/optional" code is not necessarily backed up - would we agree we need to have someone review the backup practices
      and make recommendations. We know Marist agreement does not entitle the project to backups but they might accomodate snapshot 
      backup of key environment. 
      
      2) Review diversity on the squads and look at ways to strengthen - how best to measure? - mentor programs?
