No meeting for July 8th unless someone else wants to host 

1) Follow up to PI Planning - 
    a) Any feedback? 
    b) ZLC action items? other than what is already in our issues list? 
        1) Publish of survey results? 
        2) Lessons learned from survey?
    c) Need to close on ZLC actions for PI? 
        - TSC formation?
        - Diversity metrics? 
        - Support conformance criteria? 
        - Other ? 
        
2) Zowe.org updates status? 

3) SHARE planning - I think I copied most of you on email - 3 40 mins recorded sessions is not ideal - do we want to use the sessions to spin off 
deeper dive sessions 

4) FYI - Marist prep - Zowe team meeting July 10th - monthly call with Marist July 20th 
    - HA
    - CI/CD expansion of testing 
    - Performance

5) Let's review the zlc issues https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues
