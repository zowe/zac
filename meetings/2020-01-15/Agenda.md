# ZLC Agenda 01-15-2020
Welcome Peter Fandel as rep for JP. 

John Mertic out this week. 



1. **Voting topic - new (sub?)project proposal - Zowe on the Go** - [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/157](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/157) 

   1. This project was developed during a Zowe Hackathon at Broadcom. The goal of this project was to develop a fast, on-the-move identification/triage application for mainframe operations and systems support.  "As an on-call support, my immediate needs are to check the status of running services and to perform a number of jobs services: get a list of jobs, get content from a job file output, submit a job, and more." This project adds another way modern developers and system/operations support interact with the mainframe, built against Zowe API Mediation Layer, thus bringing more value to the Zowe ecosystem and its adopters.

   1. Questions: 

      1. iPhone and Android? 

      1. Separate build environment? Assuming so where? and how to make vendor neutral? 

      1. Does OMP have the necessary license scan tools for mobile apps? 

      1. What will be say about security of such as app (z/OS customers very security conscience) 

      1. Separate squad or a subproject of existing team? 

1. **Long Term Support and backward compatibility "working session"**

   1. [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72)

   1. Are we making this too hard - do we just version CLI and z/OS Components separately and publish the LTS policy and backward compatibility matrix of which versions of CLI are backward compatible to z/OS components? 

      1. Outlook for when CLI supported on USS? LTS policy more likely going to need to follow the z/OS conventions? 

1. **Hackathon?**

1. **SHARE Sunday session**
