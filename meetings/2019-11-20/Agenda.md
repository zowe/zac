   1. Question as to whether ZLC needs to vote or if this is squad decision 

   1. Any action needed to confirm this will be included in future security and license scans? 

1. **LTS and Backward compatibility policy **

   1. Suggested edits: 

      1. **Removal of Feb 2020 as specific date in case we still - suggest 1Q2020???** 

         1. Granted we do say dates are subject to change but eyes may jump to the Feb date

      1. **Make some adjustment to end of support date of V1 by adding "..." or stating in text that source code will remain available indefinitely**

      1. Regarding backward compatibility policy - add text to the bulleted list - WE NEED TO DISCUSS IF WE WANT TO DECLARE THIS PUBLICLY AND NEED SQUADS TO REVIEW/COMMENT 

         1. **"It is the community's intent to provide N-1 compatibility for APIs, CLI plug-ins and Application Framework applications from one version to the next. This means that any extensions to Zowe will run without changes from one version to the next. Required changes from version N to N+2 will be clearly documented." **

1. **Do we need to discuss 1.8 plans and whether teams agree with these dates and have bandwidth to contribute and test? **

Zowe Community, 



As the vast majority of the Zowe Community is in favor of replacing the open seat on the ZLC, I'd like to formally open the nomination and election period. 



Based on the ZLC structure and processes ( see [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/blob/master/process/structure.md](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_zowe_zlc_blob_master_process_structure.md&d=DwMFaQ&c=jf_iaSHvJObTbx-siA1ZOg&r=QV1pgG1ijEqUgWlri9F2-4fMdhmnGC4fxVGplHz6-M0&m=mqEqEzH9Kw7b56Etz7RdCQP5STfrEw_vPL2MyYzjuoU&s=VVBiq59jP2XmJPNnjGV0I_lsWs8InlWfHTk6zKczpWI&e=) ), I'd like to propose the following schedule for the election:



TODAY: Call for Nominations, email all Zowe project committers

11/25: Nominations close, 11:59pm ET

11/27: Voting period opens, all current Zowe project committers vote, vote by electronic mail or CIVS as appropriate

12/4: Voting period ends, 11:59pm ET

12/6: Election results announced 



We have one nomination already received for Joe Winchester. If you would like to nominate someone else or nominate yourself, please email your name and rationale for serving on the ZLC to me by 11/25 at 11:59pm ET. Note that in order to serve on the ZLC, you must be a Zowe Committer
