1) 1.12 out the door - request from Chris Blum for details of the release so I can promote on Social. Should we do a couple paragraph blog post as well? 

2) Survey - I've heard no objections to content from zlc or squad leads so survey is live - 
  a) I customized URL as best I could: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/zowe2020
  b) I created a bitly version https://bit.ly/3dbKR8v (anyone know if there are pitfalls with bitly?) 
  c) Ideas to publize: 
    1) LinkedIn - someone want to post and others "like" 
    2) Slack channels 
    3) OMP assist - social campaigns, and welcome a blog post - can someone help with blog? 
    4) IBM ISV community (distribution list) 
    5) Other ideas? 
  d) Results are likely going to be late/incomplete for PI planning next week but I think it is still
  worth doing 
    1) Results will come back to OMP Survey Monkey account - I assume we can have other accounts have access? 
    Rocket and Broadcom have accounts? 
  e) John asks that we make results public - anyone object? Can someone create a repo to hold results
  f) Recommend we get into the habit of surveys like this - twice a year? Have a repo of questions? 
  Ask the Project Managers to set reminder when time to do next one? Do we want the squads to do their
  own? 
  
2) PI Planning next week - 
  a) Any edit to the Themes deck? https://ibm.box.com/s/vifryjsbzgxic3y8xl84fm22sjsj1oxa 
  b) Typical PI Planning is "business context" to kick off - ZLC to provide a "state of the union" 
  I propose using some of the May metrics https://ibm.box.com/s/6dnjxi4yovvek64k7z2xrt4asgvf3ph5 and collect info on
  customer and ISV engagements? 
  
3) What to do about SHARE "Sunday" session? Do we want to run our own Zowe update/education session? 

4) We will review https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues there are new ones needing discussion
