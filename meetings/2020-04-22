1) Conformance program status? 
  I think we agreed to use the Conformance Program web site as place to 
    a) Show V1 conformance (conformant apps/plugin/API will get a V1 badge) 
    b) Web site will show apps that have achieved beyond minimum conformance (i.e, SSO and future criteria) 
    c) We will continue to work on some way to have badges refect more that V1 minimum (either additional badge or tag on V1 badge or other)
  Where are we with getting this announced? https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/176#issuecomment-613703143
  Can we go ahead and update web site with Conformance ?????
  
2) Conformance updates first - then publish LTS description? https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/72#issuecomment-596370161 
We need to be clear with web site updates what diagram to use: https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/176#issuecomment-613706381

3) I saw in OMP Marketing meeting mins that Hackathon registration has been extended and there is additional participation
    There was Linkedin post - is there other actions we can take to grow participation? 
    Zowe Virtual Hackathon: Registration has been extended to April 30. We currently have teams from IBM, Broadcom, EXL Service and HCL Technologies. 
    Please encourage your developers to register - final submissions are not due until May 22 so there is plenty of time to get something together.
