    - Did we find out hackathon status? 
    - Was the DevOps webcast recorded? 
    - Do we have too slides? Can we trim the 14-15-16
    - Does ZLC want to sign up for more than Vendor Support Criteria??? 
    - Do members of the ZLC want to divide up coverage and sit in on squad breakouts to listen in to know about any issues we can help with? 
    - Survey analysis? 
    
2) OMP press release (today I think) - any updates?
