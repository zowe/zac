# ZLC Agenda 02-05-2020
1. **Can we close on LTS policy - limit discussion to 10 mins - vote via email**

   1. Updated deck from Joe - [Zowe.OSS.2019-20.Roadmap.Rev.12a.pptx](Zowe.OSS.2019-20.Roadmap.Rev.12a.pptx) Thanks Joe 

      1. If we agree I would like to get text in the process docs on Zowe org and try to have a quick reference page (like node.js team does). 

   1. Questions from Joe - do we need to discuss cadence? 

      1. Currently we provide a software distribution every 4-6 weeks v1 which will become active-LTS. When we begin v2 which will kick of Current, I imagine we will be building every 4-6 weeks also as we'll just switch active development to current. 

      1. **How frequently will we release active-LTS while current is in its 6-9 month period ?**

         1. Would we also release active-LTS on the same frequency as current for 6 months, and if so when would we reduce the number of distributions when the switch occurs so current becomes active and active becomes maintenance ? 

         1. Would we reduce those to be quarterly ? 

         1. Wondering if on chart 1 we should discuss when software is released from each stream, or if not whether we should call out release cadence in the roadmap ?

1. **Status of 1.8 ? RC candidate? Do we need a vote? or do so electronically? - Nick?**

   1. I've had inquires on what issues have been being worked that cause the delay - can someone summarize? 

      1. Summary from JRW.    

         1. Automatic z/OS security configuration and unconfigure for all three security managers on Marist is now fully tested end to end on every nightly build.

         1. 1.8 tech preview testing by customers and extenders raised issues requiring more validation, static and dynamic documentation

         1. Fine tuning commands and doc for creating new user IDs and admin group for Zowe separate from using z/OSMF after customer feedback.  Defining and configuring these IDs on Marist needed help ticket resolution.

         1. New JCL member required to undo z/OS configuration changes to support backout

         1. Updating Zowe USS folders to be 755 to allow read only mounting ran into unexpected issues

         1. API Mediation Layer build in 1.8 rc1 was 7 weeks old and needed updating to bring in changes that introduced issues that needed resolving.

         1. Operational difficulties turning around pipeline changes on Marist with the 1.8 separation of configuration from installation 

1. **Conformance Criteria Update - Rose (or Tim?)**

   1. [vNext Conformance Timeline LTS2020FEB25.pptx](vNext%20Conformance%20Timeline%20LTS2020FEB25.pptx) 

   1. [https://wiki.zowe.org/display/ZCP/Test+Evaluation+Guide](https://wiki.zowe.org/display/ZCP/Test+Evaluation+Guide)

1. **Press Release Status**

   1. OMP willing to wait on the LTS to make press release DEPENDING on the LTS  timing. LTS release is Feb 25 - I ASSUME is too late??? OMP has content from PR without Zowe - question on whether they would consider 2 press releases? One for Zowe later in month (or early March) 

   1. Year anniversary of Zowe - assume we can call the month of Feb the anniversary - Taylor has been collecting stats and can share info. ccing him 

   1. Sounds like Hack-a-thon proceeding but not planned for the press release? If we can get page set up we can advertise at Share, web site, social media, etc. Need Premek and Jean Louis to help document the rules for the hack-a-thon. 

1. **On Boarding squad proposal for updated process flow for Q&A - I'd like to propose this be updated on zowe.org when LTS policy updates** 

   1. [Zowe_ Managing incoming requests to OMP - Google Docs(1).pdf](../2020-01-22/Zowe_%20Managing%20incoming%20requests%20to%20OMP%20-%20Google%20Docs(1).pdf)

1. **Feb is ZLC "revote" month - John**

1. **Question on status of CLI keytar support**

   1. Plug in or in download of CLI? 

1. **Terminology: I have been guilty of this - passing along for others - Use "initial contributor" not "founding member" when referring to the 3 companies**

1. **For awareness: [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/159](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/159)** Proposal to get license for service called "AWS Device Farm"

   1. Update? I think John has made proposal 

1. **SHARE**

   1. Sunday education session 

   1. Who of ZLC will attend SHARE - can we plan a face to face 

1. **Next steps for mobile app? (Update next week)**

1. **Zowe 1.9.0 (January 28, 2020 - February 25, 2020)**

   1. Sprint 1 (Jan 28, 2020 - Feb 10, 2020)

      1. SMP/E PTF Support (Convenience build upgrade documentation)

      1. Node v12 Support (target)

   1.  Sprint 2 (Feb 11, 2020 - Feb 24, 2020)

   1. Code Complete/RC Candidate Build (Feb 21, 2020)

   1. Playback (February 24, 2020)

   1. 1.9.0 GA (February 25 2020) (will include LTS and GA of SMP/E PTF Support)

1. **IMS REST APIs as part of Zowe convenience build  (Update next week)**

   1. Discussions with the IMS team, 

      1. For the CLI they want to be conformant and described in the zowe.org docs, similar to DB2 and CICS CLI pliugins

      1. they have a Springboot dynamic API discoverable runtime for their APIs and want to distribute this on zowe.org.   More investigation will take place for optimal way to do this, and stop gap is for it to be available on a twistie tab similar to "pre-release-builds", e.g. "API extensions" that would link to the download site of the springboot.pax and its install and configure docs.
